# Comp2402
Collection of Java assignments. a1, a2, and a5 have received full marks, while a3 wasn't attempted and a4 received half marks due to runtime errors.
In general, all files beginning with "Fast" are coded by me with skeleton code given by professor Alina Shaikhet. "Slow" implementations and other files are used for testing and a naive implementation.
These assignments are used to demonstrate the use of big O to make code and data structure implementations more efficient over large datasets and commands, however at the cost of additional space. 

Assignment specifications available upon request.
